Description
===========

"[GLFW]_ is an Open Source, multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input and events.
It is easy to integrate into existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.

GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license."
