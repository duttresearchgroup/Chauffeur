# Inference Samples (C++)

This directory contains C++ examples of using `jetson-inference` for image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, and other DNNs for computer vision.  Refer to the [tutorial steps](../README.md#hello-ai-world-inference-only) for information about running these.

> **note**:  for Python samples, see the [**`python/examples/`**](../python/examples) directory.
