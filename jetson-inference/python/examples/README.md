# Inference Samples (Python)

This directory contains Python examples of using jetson-inference for image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, and other DNNs for computer vision.  Refer to the [tutorial steps](../../README.md#hello-ai-world-inference-only) for information about running these examples.

For examples of working with numpy arrays, see [`cuda-from-numpy.py`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-utils/blob/master/python/examples/cuda-from-numpy.py) and [`cuda-to-numpy.py`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-utils/blob/master/python/examples/cuda-to-numpy.py)

> **note**:  for C++ samples, see the [**`jetson-inference/examples/`**](../../examples).
